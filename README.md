# Reddit Stress Detection Using NLP

## Project Description

This project examines how stress is expressed in Reddit posts and whether stress-related content can be identified using natural language processing and data mining techniques. The analysis focuses on text-based signals such as emotional language, sentiment cues, and engagement patterns. The goal is not to diagnose individuals, but to study recurring patterns of stress expression in online discussions and understand the limitations and risks of automated emotional inference.

The project is limited to Reddit data and explicitly acknowledges platform-specific bias, informal language, and the challenges of interpreting mental states from text alone.
