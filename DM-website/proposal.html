        <h2>Research Topic and Scope</h2>
        <p>Understanding how psychological stress is expressed in Reddit posts using data mining and text analysis techniques

Identifying linguistic, emotional, and engagement-based signals that indicate stress in online discussions
</p>
        <p>Analyze Reddit data from the Dreaddit dataset and additional posts/comments collected via the Reddit API

Focus on text-based signals only, including language patterns, emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, negative emotion), and basic engagement features

Apply data preprocessing, sentiment and emotion analysis, classification, clustering, and pattern mining methods

Limit conclusions to Reddit users and clearly acknowledge platform and demographic biases
</p>
        
        <h2>Research Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Is there any way we can identify only the active users (eliminate deleted users and their posts from the PRAW response)?</li>
            <li>What words, emotional expressions commonly appear in stressful posts compared to non-stressful posts ?</li>
            <li>Do stressful posts show any pattern with the time of day and calendar date?</li>
            <li>What limitations arise when using reddit data for psychological stress study? </li>
            <li>Can stress intensity be estimated from text with reasonable confidence?</li>
            <li>Is there any way we can identify the users that have made a self-disclosure of their diagnosis in any other reddit communities?</li>
            <li>How do we obtain the data for mental-health distress communities and non-mental health related communities, should we search for words that work similar with (depression/anxiety…)?</li>
            <li>How many latest/old posts should I consider at the user-level to compare with the mental health distress communities to classify that the particular user  is actually under distress?</li>
            <li>Can we perform EDA and identify any temporal features from the dataset? like dependent attributes that can be tracked from reddit posts before and after a diagnosis is declared by the user, so that we can actually analyse the distress level of a person</li>
            <li>Will it be overfitting or underfitting in a possible way since we are only using reddit trained data against the actual reddit post data?</li>
            <li>Will there be any difference between the actual original posts and the content that has linked posts, which is more likely to be considered stressful in this case and how to handle them?</li>
        </ol>
