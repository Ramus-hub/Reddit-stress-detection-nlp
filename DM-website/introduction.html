        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Our research looks at how people express psychological stress on Reddit and whether that stress can be identified reliably using data mining methods. We focus on the words people use, emotional signals such as anxiety or negativity, and basic engagement information like the subreddit where a post appears or how others respond to it. By studying these signals together, we aim to recognize stressed content, explore recurring stress-related topics, and get a sense of how intense that stress might be in different posts. To do this, we work with large Reddit datasets, including the Dreaddit dataset and additional data collected through the Reddit API, and apply techniques such as text cleaning, sentiment and emotion analysis, classification, clustering, and pattern discovery.

This topic is important because stress and mental health struggles often show up online long before people seek help offline. Reddit, in particular, allows users to speak openly and anonymously, which makes it a rich space for observing how stress appears in everyday language. At the same time, the sheer volume of content makes it unrealistic to rely on manual review. Our work shows how data mining and natural language processing can help surface early signs of stress at scale, highlight common emotional and linguistic patterns, and support more proactive awareness around mental health.

The findings from this research can benefit several groups. Online communities and moderators can use these insights to better recognize when users may be struggling and respond in more supportive ways. Mental health researchers and practitioners gain a clearer picture of how stress is communicated in real, unfiltered conversations. Platform designers and policymakers can use this knowledge to inform early-intervention tools or well-being focused features. Finally, for students and data scientists, this project serves as a practical example of applying classification, clustering, and text mining techniques to a real dataset with meaningful social impact. Overall, the project demonstrates how data mining can move beyond purely technical or business applications and be used to support human well-being through data-driven insights.</p>

        <p>Using reddit data to study stress affects not only the person who posts on reddit, but it also influences a wider audience beyond the platform. Because the data is processed, labelled, and reused across various platforms even without showing it is coming from reddit. Reddit data is kind of used like a knowledge base for public audience who consume it from a variety of sources. People posting on reddit are the starting point of these emotions. Identifying stressful emotion is kind of helpful but that does not solve the whole problem. Because it can throw warning signal even for normal emotions which are relevant in the discussion happening there. Moderators and Reddit platform may automate this, but it only works based on the assumptions and data it is fed to train. Researchers and mental health professionals may get insights from large volumes of data from reddit. But the absence of conversation context and the situational awareness absence will limit the scope of it’s use. Engineers in reddit also directly impacted as they must balance both ethical responsibilities and performance goals. On a high level, society is affected by increasing algorithms which interpret emotional states. Irrespective of platforms reliability it narrows down to user’s who should be aware of platform where the content originates. They need to be aware of what is generated and where is it fetching data from and make sure if the emotions shown in the responses are relevant or not. 
</p>
        <p>The issue grows further once reddit content is consumed indirectly. As reddit is an upstream system for lot of search engines and AI searches. Many people see reddit conversations in search engines and believe it is factual and get’s data from a relevant source. But reddit is a community based knowledge sharing platform. So no one can guarantee if the information that showed up in search engine fetched from reddit is legit and emotions are relevant for the user who searched it on a Search engine. Same goes to AI searches as well. The scenario even gets worser here. AI collects data from several different sources and no one can assure whether it is accurate. The situation gets even bad when the data is fetched from reddit, The emotions should be tagged as noise or useful is very sceptical and almost impossible to filter it. The readers will often tend to miss out on the tone, background setting, situation. AI projects subjective experiences as factual statements. Responsibility also shifts towards those building and deploying the models to prevent this emotional carry away from happening.
Recognizing these downstream users makes essential that stress detection on Reddit is a much important pipeline with a lot of stakeholders with real-world effects. Ultimately, this raises concerns about the responsibility of people and platforms to ensure accuracy in information with relevant emotions.</p>

This paper has considered checking for different kinds of mental health issues, by analyzing the sub reddit channels, r/depression, r/anxiety, r/mentalhealth, /bipolar etc to identify different patterns of each mental health issue and how different people communicate this online. They have considered these 4 non-mental health channels (r/cleanjokes, r/teaching, r/relationships, r/conspiracy) to differentiate the mental health user posts to generic reddit user posts. They have performed sentimental analysis using the LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) software that is used in counting specific sections of words that showcases negative emotions, anxiety terms to identify what is unique to each community channel. They further mentioned they have identified each subreddit channel has their own word patterns (depression users has more "I" word used, death words and sadness), Anxiety users has more worry words, body terms and fear language used, and some other word patterns in the other sub-reddit channels. The paper also mentions, they have used BERT model to convert the post to numerical patterns and they have used clustering to group similar posts together automatically. UMAP is used later to visualize and understand if the clusters previously created are accurate and HDBSCAN is later on used as a validator to actually check if they are not overlapping with other clusters. The paper mentions they have identified that 90 out of 93 language features were significantly different between the two groups. HDBSCAN was able to validate and group the posts accurately to multiple sub reddit communities from ranges 86% - 99%. Further when checked with normal posts of reddit from the other communities they were able to identify and classify 99.8–99.9% of the posts within them. The limitations in this paper discussed are that they were not able to associate that the user has actually been diagnosed with that particular disease just based on the post he has made in the sub reddit channel. As most of the reddit users live in English speaking regions, only posts made in English were studied in this case. In order to expand the scope and solve the bigger problem they think further research should focus on other mainly used languages too. </p>
        <p>The team will explore the posts from the sub reddit channels (r/depression, r/anxiety, r/mentalhealth and others) by using the Reddit API and extract the posts and other attributes along with the metadata of the user posts such as temporal features and information. We will then try to identify the active users that have posts made to the communities and will extract features from the data that would help us identify if the particular user is actually under some diagnosis that categorizes under that reddit channel. This was one of the limitations that was mentioned in the above discussed papers and we aim to solve it using data mining techniques to identify and classify it probably with the help of natural language processing models. This way we will have more labelled data (self - disclosed users along with their posts) combined with the Dreaddit dataset that we currently have for training the models over text and other temporal features. We will use the Reddit API and assuming it has normal, generic content we will try to test our model with this data and identify the precision and relevant accuracy scores at the user-level and calculate the false positives and other parameters in the real - world platform scenario. Once the model is trained and tested we also plan to recommend some sub-reddit communities to the users based on the level of stress they are in. We plan to  further redirect these reddit users to some other communities that can help them improve their positivity and uplift their mood. Recommendations of these reddit channels would also be from similar cluster group the user was recently interacting with. This data is again fetched from the Reddit API. For this project currently we plan to use 2 data sources as listed below.</p>
