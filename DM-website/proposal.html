        <h2>Research Topic and Scope</h2>
        <p>Understanding how psychological stress is expressed in Reddit posts using data mining and text analysis techniques

Identifying linguistic, emotional, and engagement-based signals that indicate stress in online discussions
</p>
        <p>Analyze Reddit data from the Dreaddit dataset and additional posts/comments collected via the Reddit API

Focus on text-based signals only, including language patterns, emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, negative emotion), and basic engagement features

Apply data preprocessing, sentiment and emotion analysis, classification, clustering, and pattern mining methods

Limit conclusions to Reddit users and clearly acknowledge platform and demographic biases
</p>
